                    <p>I’m an Information Technology specialized in Game Development student with a growing interest in cybersecurity. I enjoy building interactive experiences through games while also learning how systems work behind the scenes—and how to protect them. I like mixing creativity with logic, whether that’s designing gameplay mechanics or understanding how security vulnerabilities happen.</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="color: #dc2626; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I started my academic path in Game Development, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, game logic, and problem-solving. Along the way, I became curious about how games, networks, and systems can be exploited or secured. This curiosity pushed me to explore cybersecurity through broad learning platforms such as Hack The Box, where I’m currently following the Junior Cybersecurity Path, and Cisco Networking Academy, where I’m building a strong foundation in networking and security concepts.</p>
